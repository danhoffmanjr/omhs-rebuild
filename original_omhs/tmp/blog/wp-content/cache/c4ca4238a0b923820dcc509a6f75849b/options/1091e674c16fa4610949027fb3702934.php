This version includes a number of new features, most notably Widgets integration, and over two hundred bug fixes. It&#8217;s named in honor of tenor saxophonist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stan_Getz">Stan Getz</a>.</p>
<h3>Goodies:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>WordPress Widgets</strong> allow you to easily rearrange and customize areas of your weblog (usually sidebars) with drag-and-drop simplicity. This functionality was originally available as a plugin Widgets are now included by default in the core code, significantly cleaned up, and enabled for the default themes.</li>
<li><strong>Full Atom support</strong>, including updating our Atom feeds to use the 1.0 standard spec and including an implementation of the Atom Publishing API to complement our XML-RPC interface.</li>
<li>A <strong>new Blogger importer</strong> that is able to handle the latest version of Google&#8217;s Blogger product and seamlessly import posts and comments without any user interaction beyond entering your login.</li>
<li><strong>Infinite comment stream</strong>, meaning that on your Edit Comments page when you delete or spam a comment using the AJAX links under each comment it will bring in another comment in the background so you always have 20 items on the page. (I know it sounds geeky, but try it!)</li>
<li>We now protect you from activating a plugin or editing a file that will break your blog.</li>
<li>Core plugin and filter <strong>speed optimizations</strong> should make everything feel a bit more snappy and lighter on your server.</li>
<li>We&#8217;ve added a hook for <strong>WYSIWYG support in a future version of Safari</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition there were also dozens of UI and accessibility improvements, ranging from more concise wording around options and links to things like a view and preview link above the content box when you&#8217;re editing a post or page, as well as several important security fixes. We don&#8217;t plan to continue to support the 2.1 branch, so this is a required upgrade.</p>
<h3>Developer Features:</h3>
<p>We also improved a great deal under the hood that hopefully you&#8217;ll never notice, but if you&#8217;re a developer for the WP platform it provides a lot to sink your teeth into. Here is a sampling:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new set of WordPress-specific XML-RPC APIs that allow for editing pages, setting categories, and much more.</li>
<li>We now use jQuery for a number of internal functions, and hope to transition all of our JS to use it. (We <a href="http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/3824">still need volunteers</a> for this.)</li>
<li>Comment feeds now support multiple formats, including Atom.</li>
<li>Our internal mail functions now use phpMailer, which allows for things like SMTP support.</li>
<li>You can now set database collation and character set in your config file.</li>
<li>You can also hardcode your site and WP URL in the config file, overriding the values in the DB.</li>
<li>Finally we&#8217;ve increased the inline documentation of a number of functions inside of WP, which should help you navigate those parts of the code.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you&#8217;d like an in-depth look at everything that changed, <a href="http://trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&amp;milestone=2.2">here is a list of all 244 closed tickets</a> in our bug tracker and you can <a href="http://trac.wordpress.org/changeset?old_path=tags%2F2.1.3&amp;old=5468&amp;new_path=tags%2F2.2&amp;new=5480">use this link</a> to see what files and lines of code changed. (It was a lot!)</p>
<h3>New Development Cycle</h3>
<p>Most interesting about this release is that is our first under the new, experimental development cycle that we <a href="http://wordpress.org/development/2007/01/ella-21/">first talked about when we released version 2.1 fewer than 4 months ago</a>. We delayed a few weeks from our target date in April, but ended up under our original goal of a 4 month major release cycle. My thanks and congratulations to the entire WordPress community for pulling together and making that happen. It wasn&#8217;t without its bumps, but the things we learned along the way will make our next release in September even better. You can now look forward to a fast but stable schedule of new features and goodies several times a year from WordPress.</p>
<h3>Around the Community</h3>
<p>There were 1.4 million downloads of WordPress 2.1 in the four months it was available.</p>
<p>I <a href="http://photomatt.net/2007/05/10/meaningful-overnight-relationship/">wrote a post that covers some of the media that WP has been getting lately</a> and its history.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve expanded WordPress.org quite a bit, most notably the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/">very active plugins directory</a> and the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/ideas/">ideas forum</a>.</p>
<p>Come meet other WordPress users and developers at <a href="http://wordcamp.org/">WordCamp</a>, which is going to be taking place July 21-22 in San Francisco.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget to check out WordPress&#8217; cousins <a href="http://mu.wordpress.org/">MU</a> and <a href="http://bbpress.org/">bbPress</a>, both of which have been seeing some pretty cool development lately.</p>
<h3>Help Out</h3>
<p>The most valuable thing you can give back to WordPress is your time &#8212; the time to help a friend discover the joy of blogging, the time to help a stanger (a friend you haven&#8217;t met yet) on the <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/">support forums</a>, or the time to help make WordPress a <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Contributing_to_WordPress">better product</a>.</p>

<p>Another movement close to my heart, Barcamp, <a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampAustin">is in full effect here in Austin</a>. <strong>Saturday March 10 at 6 PM we&#8217;re going to do a WordPress meetup</strong> at the Barcamp venue Bourbon Rocks on 6th Street. Unlike many other SxSW parties, it is completely open to the public and doesn&#8217;t require a conference badge. There will be food and drinks available, and a live band after we wrap up the meetup.</p>
<p>So come enjoy part of your SxSW evening in this beautiful Austin weather with fellow WordPressers. In addition to the good company, we&#8217;ll have an assortment of cool WordPress stickers free for the taking.</p>
<p>Finally if you&#8217;re attending the conference part of SxSW Interactive, be sure to check out the following cool speakers who are WordPress users like yourself:</p>

Here&#8217;s a sampling of what&#8217;s in the new version:</p>
<ul>
<li> <strong>Autosave</strong> makes sure you never lose a post again. </li>
<li> Our new <strong>tabbed editor</strong> allows you to switch between WYSIWYG and code editing instantly while writing a post. </li>
<li> The <strong>lossless XML import and export</strong> makes it easy for you to move your content between WordPress blogs. </li>
<li> Our completely redone visual editor also now includes <strong>spell checking</strong>. </li>
<li> <strong>New search engine privacy option</strong> allows you take you to indicate your blog shouldn&#8217;t ping or be indexed by search engines like Google. </li>
<li> You can set any &#8220;page&#8221; to be the front page of your site, and put the latest posts somewhere else, making it much easier to use WordPress as a content management system. </li>
<li> Much more efficient database code, faster than previous versions. <a href="http://dammit.lt/">Domas Mituzas</a> from MySQL went over all our queries with a fine-toothed comb. </li>
<li> Links in your blogroll now support sub-categories and you can add categories on the fly. </li>
<li> Redesigned login screen from the Shuttle project. </li>
<li> More AJAX to make custom fields, moderation, deletions, and more all faster. My favorite is the comments page, which new lets you approve or unapprove things instantly. </li>
<li> Pages can now be drafts, or private. </li>
<li> Our admin has been refreshed to load faster and be more visually consistent. </li>
<li> The dashboard now loads instantly and brings RSS feeds asynchronously in the background. </li>
<li> Comment feeds now include all the comments, not just the last 10. </li>
<li> Better internationalization and support for right-to-left languages. </li>
<li> The <strong>upload manager</strong> lets you easily manage all your uploads pictures, video, and audio. </li>
<li> A <a href="http://akismet.com/blog/2007/01/version-20/">new version of the Akismet plugin</a> is bundled. </li>
</ul>
<p>&#8230;and much, much more. There are little easter eggs hidden everywhere, so the best way to find everything new is to <a href="http://wordpress.org/download/">just try it out</a>.</p>
<h3>Developer Features</h3>
<p>Developers will especially love this release, as it has much cleaner code than 2.0 and includes hundreds of enhancements that will enable a new generation of richer plugins. Here&#8217;s a taste of some of the things included:</p>
<ul>
<li> Psuedo-cron functionality let&#8217;s you schedule events much like cron. </li>
<li> Users admin can now comfortably handle hundreds of thousands of users. </li>
<li> The new WP_Error class cleans up how we do error reporting and handling. </li>
<li> The javascript loader makes it easier for plugins to include rich functionality. </li>
<li> Tons of new hooks and APIs. </li>
<li> We&#8217;ve started to fill out our code inline documentation. </li>
<li> Image and thumbnail API allows for richer media plugins. </li>
<li> Custom header, color picker, and image cropping framework. </li>
</ul>
<p>2.1 also <a href="http://trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&#038;milestone=2.1">includes over 550 bug fixes</a>.</p>
<h3>The Future</h3>
<p>What&#8217;s really exciting for me is what&#8217;s coming in the future. First of all, the 2.0 series was an unparalleled success, with over 1.8 million downloads, and thanks to the work of Mark Jaquith we&#8217;re committing to maintaining stable security and bug fixes on the 2.0 branch until 2010.</p>
<p>More exciting for most of our users, though, is our new development cycle. Based on everything we&#8217;ve learned in the past 3 years of doing WordPress, we&#8217;ve decided to shift to a more frequent release schedule like Ubuntu, with major releases coming several times a year. So, for the first time in WordPress&#8217; history, I have an answer to when the next version is coming out: April 23rd.</p>
<p>Even better, the development will be driven primarily by <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/ideas/">the features you guys are voting for on the ideas board</a>. (But wait, there&#8217;s more: the ideas board now has a new Hot-or-Not-like interface for rating a bunch of ideas at once, <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/ideas/view.php?view=not_voted">so go get your vote on and have a say in WordPress 2.2</a>.)</p>

We&#8217;re able to work around it fairly easily, so we&#8217;ve decided to release 2.0.7 to fix the PHP security problem and the Feedburner issue that was in 2.0.6. It is recommended that everyone running WordPress 2.0.6 or lower <a href="http://wordpress.org/download/">upgrade to this new version</a>.</p>
<p>Because this is a much smaller update than previous versions, you do not have to update all of WordPress&#8217; files if you&#8217;re upgrading from version 2.0.6.  Here is the list of files that have changed since 2.0.6:</p>
<ul>
<li>wp-admin/inline-uploading.php</li>
<li>wp-admin/post.php</li>
<li>wp-includes/classes.php</li>
<li>wp-includes/functions.php</li>
<li>wp-settings.php</li>
<li>wp-includes/version.php</li>
</ul>
<p>We know it sucks to have a release only 10 days after our last one, but we think it&#8217;s important enough for your blog to be secure to do it, and hopefully only having to change a few files will make the upgrade easier than normal.</p>
<p>Here are the changes that have been made since 2.0.6:</p>
<ul>
<li>Security fix for <code>wp_unregister_GLOBALS()</code> to work around the <a href="http://www.hardened-php.net/hphp/zend_hash_del_key_or_index_vulnerability.html">zend_hash_del_key_or_index bug</a> in PHP 4 versions less than 4.4.3 and PHP 5 versions less than 5.1.4 with <code>register_globals</code> set to &#8220;On.&#8221;</li>
<li>Feeds now properly serve <code>304 Not Modified</code> headers instead of mismatched 200/304 headers (a.k.a. the FeedBurner bug).</li>
<li>Backport of another <code>304 Not Modified</code> fix from WordPress 2.1</li>
<li>Deleting WordPress Pages no longer gives an &#8220;Are You Sure?&#8221; prompt.</li>
<li>After deleting a WordPress Page, you are now properly redirected to the Edit Pages screen.</li>
<li>Sending an image at original size in Internet Explorer no longer adds an incorrect &#8220;height&#8221; attribute.</li>
</ul>
<p>And just as a reminder, the next major version of WordPress (2.1) is due out by the end of the month, but the 2.0 branch of WordPress will continue to be maintained for several years.</p>

<li>Security fix for <code>wp_unregister_GLOBALS()</code> to work around the <a href="http://www.hardened-php.net/hphp/zend_hash_del_key_or_index_vulnerability.html">zend_hash_del_key_or_index bug</a> in PHP 4 versions less than 4.4.3 and PHP 5 versions less than 5.1.4 with <code>register_globals</code> set to &#8220;On.&#8221;</li>
<li>Feeds now properly serve <code>304 Not Modified</code> headers instead of mismatched 200/304 headers (a.k.a. the FeedBurner bug).</li>
<li>Backport of another <code>304 Not Modified</code> fix from WordPress 2.1</li>
<li>Deleting WordPress Pages no longer gives an &#8220;Are You Sure?&#8221; prompt.</li>
<li>After deleting a WordPress Page, you are now properly redirected to the Edit Pages screen.</li>
<li>Sending an image at original size in Internet Explorer no longer adds an incorrect &#8220;height&#8221; attribute.</li>
</ul>
<p>And just as a reminder, the next major version of WordPress (2.1) is due out by the end of the month, but the 2.0 branch of WordPress will continue to be maintained for several years.</p>

This allows people outside our normal circle of developers to have a direct say in what goes into the next version of WordPress. For 2.2, which comes out in late April, we will include the top voted on features, so propose something, tell your friends about it, and link it from your blog.</p>
<p>The second we&#8217;ve named after the <a href="http://www.answers.com/kvetch">Yiddish word</a>, <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/kvetch/">Kvetch</a>. This is a place where you can quickly and anonymously express whatever might disagree with you in the WordPress world. Let it all loose, but try to keep it PG rated, and we&#8217;ll show a random kvetch on the page once we get enough in the system.</p>
<p>Both are just part of putting you guys&#8212;our users&#8212;first. It&#8217;s easy because there&#8217;s so many of you.</p>
