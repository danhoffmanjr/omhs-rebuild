The long months of your tolerance and forbearance as you suffered through the inelegance of our hacked-together, leftover  Crazyhorse interface are almost at an end. (Was it really that painful?)</p>
<p>The visuals you have been craving are finally finished enough to show, and have been approved by the lead developers. We hope you like them. Mad props to Matt Thomas and Andy Peatling for their visual talents. You can expect these designs to be extended to the rest of the 2.7 screens and implemented over the coming weeks.</p>
<p>So now that we finally nailed down the look, how&#8217;s it going to work? The menu system in particular has been the topic of discussion on the hackers and testers lists, so I thought I would take this opportunity to explain how we plan for it to work. As you know, one of the goals of 2.7 was to reduce the necessity to load new screens just to access sub-navigation menus; we wanted the most-used screens to be within a click or two at most. If you&#8217;ve been using the nightly builds, you got used to the arrow controls that allowed you to expand and contract the menus. Then you got used to the box-style with icons that not only opened and closed vertically, but could be minimized horizontally as well, leaving a remnant of icons to provide a kind of &#8220;advanced mode,&#8221; though you don&#8217;t need to be particularly advanced to use it. Now that we have real button styles (the icons are still placeholders, and we hope to have some new ones soonish), we&#8217;ve nailed down the menu functionality.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img title="2.7 New Post Screen, Unfinished" src="http://wpdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/newpost.png" alt="2.7 New Post Screen, Unfinished" width="597" height="402" /><p class="wp-caption-text">2.7 New Post Screen, Unfinished</p></div>
<p>Each section header has three parts: the icon on the left, the blue link text, and the area to the right where an expansion arrow appears on hover or in expanded state. You can see that the arrow is contained in a small segment of the header, similar to the way the favorites menu is structured. If you click on this segment, the menu will expand to show the choices in that section.  Click again to close the menu. Click on the blue link text and you will go directly to the screen for the first choice in that section, where the section menu will be opened to show you the other section choices. Double-click on the section icon and the menu will close horizontally, leaving the icon list visible. In this state, hovering over the icons will display the menus for each section, so you&#8217;re still only a click away from most screens. Double-click on an icon when the menu is closed this way and it will take you to the first screen in that section. The small arrows attached to the dividing lines between menu groups will also act as open/close toggles for using the horizontal collapse/expand function.</p>
<p>This variety of ways of using the menu system aims to accommodate both power user and novice alike. Clicking on blue link text like normal will bring the expected result for the novice, while the advanced user has more options for navigation that allow a more customized experience. We hope you like this result as much as we do, and you can expect to see it implemented in Trunk soon.</p>
<p>The image below is the new Dashboard style, for which I&#8217;ll save the explanations until early next week, but hopefully the preview will get you excited for the new design.</p>

Today we finally get to announce that we&#8217;ve acquired the market-leading poll and survey service <a href="http://polldaddy.com/">PollDaddy</a>.</p>
<p>For a year or two now, I&#8217;ve been minorly obsessed with polls and surveys as a method of lightweight interaction that engages casual users of your website and also can get you some really fun data to play with. I&#8217;ve also mentioned at a few WordCamps that a polling plugin is one of the top 10 WordPress plugins in the world. Polls are <em>really</em> popular with WordPress users.</p>
<p>As we started to look at building out our own service for this, it became more obvious that, while on the surface it&#8217;s a very simple problem, there&#8217;s a lot of hidden complexity and opportunities for some really powerful features under the hood. There are probably a dozen companies addressing this space right now, but as we started to survey the space I was struck by how often I&#8217;d see this &#8220;PollDaddy&#8221; thing pop up.</p>
<p>Two guys in Ireland with a quirky company name were cleaning up with some of the largest and most respected websites using their service on a daily basis. They weren&#8217;t the biggest, but they had the high end of the market. It seemed to be the WordPress of the polling space.</p>
<p>I took a secret trip to Sligo and put back a few pints with the team and we decided to make things work. They went to bed every night and woke up every morning thinking about polls and surveys, and were iterating at a great pace. By plugging into Automattic&#8217;s experience at creating internet-scale services and the distribution of WordPress.com, I knew we could take Polldaddy to an entirely new level in a relatively short amount of time.</p>
<p>Today <a href="http://en.blog.wordpress.com/2008/10/15/polldaddy/">we just enabled PollDaddy integration with 4.4 million blogs on WordPress.com</a> and have <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/polldaddy/">released the first version of their .org plugin</a>.</p>

And he wants your help. Over the next month or so, Amir will be taking your advice on this blog to help him create his community tourist site with WordPress. As with all such endeavors, it begins with a plan.</em></p>
<p><strong>By <a href="http://www.icanlocalize.com" title="Amir Helzer">Amir Helzer</a></strong></p>
<p><img src="http://lorelle.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/bariloche1.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="" title="bariloche Island Mountains" width="300" height="225" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3109" />I&#8217;ve been living in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bariloche" title="Bariloche, Argentina">Bariloche, Argentina</a>, for the past few years. It&#8217;s a small town, so folks know each other pretty well.  A popular tourist destination, everyone here is doing something with tourists, from renting out cabañas to ski instructors, trout fishing guides to para-gliding. As a web expert, friends often ask if I can help them build a website for their business. They hear that it&#8217;s a good way to get new business, especially rich folks from the US and Europe. We may be a calm and relaxing vacation destination, however, we are also determined business people.</p>
<p>Most locals are familiar with static websites, with enough content for a contact page and photo gallery showing off the same tourist images of Bariloche. Recently, I decided instead of meeting their needs individually, I would create a community site for tourist information with WordPress. It will be called <a href="http://www.baripedia.com" title="Baripedia">Baripedia</a>.</p>
<p>This is not a common project and I need your help and input to make this tourist community site work with WordPress. I&#8217;ll be asking WordPress to do a lot of things that stretch it in many ways, ways we aren&#8217;t very familiar with. I think it&#8217;s the right tool for the job, but making WordPress do what we ask of it pushes it beyond its traditional usage. Want to help?</p>
<h3>The Challenges of a Community Tourist Site</h3>
<p>Most businesses appearing on Baripedia will need the basics and a bit more:</p>
<ul>
<li>A few &#8217;static&#8217; pages, like a home page and details about different things they offer.</li>
<li>A contact page.</li>
<li>Order processing, so that visitors can pay online for products, lodging, and services.</li>
<li>News and events.</li>
<li>Map locater (such as Google maps, but it isn&#8217;t available in Argentina).</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a variety of challenges facing a community site focused on tourism. It must represent the community as well as each business involved. Here are some of the challenges involved:</p>
<p>Each company must have a page of information about their products and services with contact information.</p>
<ol>
<li>Ecommerce WordPress Plugins must also serve each individual company from within the site.</li>
<li>We need to decide how to incorporate each business into the site. Should we use <a href="http://mu.wordpress.org/" title="WordPressMU" rel="tag">WordPressMU</a> and give each business their own &#8220;blog&#8221; with a front entry blog that links all of the individual ones within the network together? Or have one self-hosted version of WordPress that serves all the businesses?</li>
<li>Decide how much &#8220;freedom&#8221; and control each business would have over their &#8220;pages&#8221; and content. What if one business gets into blogging and writes over 100 blog posts quickly while the others write only a couple?</li>
<li>Decide what content will go into the community site and which business will contribute what content. Do we need a community editor that will keep the blog going or will each business contribute fairly equally?</li>
<li>Decide the format of the design and structure. Will it be a newspaper/magazine style, or should it be more commercial and aimed strictly towards high end vacation customers? Or maybe it should be very community-oriented and &#8220;friendly&#8221;, representing the relaxed tourist community?</li>
<li>We need functions that are not blog-oriented, such as table views of different businesses with filtering and sorting features. How do we build these functions so that they&#8217;re agile and will not easily break when WordPress updates.</li>
</ol>

To work well, over time, people need to get a real benefit, which can be measured. There are three main things people need it for:</p>
<ol>
<li>To have a URL to print on business cards, brochures and other printed stuff.</li>
<li>A URL to give to other websites. I&#8217;m talking about these separately, as this URL can be ask long and complex as needed, while the other must be short.</li>
<li>To get traffic from search engines and people who know the &#8216;portal&#8217;.</li>
</ol>
<p>While an independent website, on its own domain would be best for having a short and nice URL, it&#8217;s the least fitting for the other two needs. In reality, if there are hundreds of similar businesses, in the same town, Google is not likely to return the website of a particular one, when it can return the website of a directory. Especially if the directory is rich in contents and adheres to web standards.</p>
<p>Ideally, we should find a solution which lets every business feel like he&#8217;s got his own patch on the net, where he can express himself and be competitive, while the entire site acts as a high quality resource for information about Bariloche. Your suggestions?</p>

And he wants your help. Over the next month or so, Amir will be taking your advice on this blog to help him create his community tourist site with WordPress. As with all such endeavors, it begins with a plan.</em></p>
<p><strong>By <a href="http://www.icanlocalize.com" title="Amir Helzer">Amir Helzer</a></strong></p>
<p><img src="http://lorelle.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/bariloche1.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="" title="bariloche Island Mountains" width="300" height="225" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3109" />I&#8217;ve been living in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bariloche" title="Bariloche, Argentina">Bariloche, Argentina</a>, for the past few years. It&#8217;s a small town, so folks know each other pretty well.  A popular tourist destination, everyone here is doing something with tourists, from renting out cabañas to ski instructors, trout fishing guides to para-gliding. As a web expert, friends often ask if I can help them build a website for their business. They hear that it&#8217;s a good way to get new business, especially rich folks from the US and Europe. We may be a calm and relaxing vacation destination, however, we are also determined business people.</p>
<p>Most locals are familiar with static websites, with enough content for a contact page and photo gallery showing off the same tourist images of Bariloche. Recently, I decided instead of meeting their needs individually, I would create a community site for tourist information with WordPress. It will be called <a href="http://www.baripedia.com" title="Baripedia">Baripedia</a>.</p>
<p>This is not a common project and I need your help and input to make this tourist community site work with WordPress. I&#8217;ll be asking WordPress to do a lot of things that stretch it in many ways, ways we aren&#8217;t very familiar with. I think it&#8217;s the right tool for the job, but making WordPress do what we ask of it pushes it beyond its traditional usage. Want to help?</p>
<h3>The Challenges of a Community Tourist Site</h3>
<p>Most businesses appearing on Baripedia will need the basics and a bit more:</p>
<ul>
<li>A few &#8217;static&#8217; pages, like a home page and details about different things they offer.</li>
<li>A contact page.</li>
<li>Order processing, so that visitors can pay online for products, lodging, and services.</li>
<li>News and events.</li>
<li>Map locater (such as Google maps, but it isn&#8217;t available in Argentina).</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a variety of challenges facing a community site focused on tourism. It must represent the community as well as each business involved. Here are some of the challenges involved:</p>
<p>Each company must have a page of information about their products and services with contact information.</p>
<ol>
<li>Ecommerce WordPress Plugins must also serve each individual company from within the site.</li>
<li>We need to decide how to incorporate each business into the site. Should we use <a href="http://mu.wordpress.org/" title="WordPressMU" rel="tag">WordPressMU</a> and give each business their own &#8220;blog&#8221; with a front entry blog that links all of the individual ones within the network together? Or have one self-hosted version of WordPress that serves all the businesses?</li>
<li>Decide how much &#8220;freedom&#8221; and control each business would have over their &#8220;pages&#8221; and content. What if one business gets into blogging and writes over 100 blog posts quickly while the others write only a couple?</li>
<li>Decide what content will go into the community site and which business will contribute what content. Do we need a community editor that will keep the blog going or will each business contribute fairly equally?</li>
<li>Decide the format of the design and structure. Will it be a newspaper/magazine style, or should it be more commercial and aimed strictly towards high end vacation customers? Or maybe it should be very community-oriented and &#8220;friendly&#8221;, representing the relaxed tourist community?</li>
<li>We need functions that are not blog-oriented, such as table views of different businesses with filtering and sorting features. How do we build these functions so that they&#8217;re agile and will not easily break when WordPress updates.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="http://lorelle.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/bariloche2.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="" title="bariloche - vacation skiing in Argentina" width="300" height="225" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3110" />To choose right, we must remember what&#8217;s important to the people who would eventually participate in this project.

<p>This is the first installment of &#8220;WordPress Wednesday&#8221;, which I mentioned in my previous post about <a title="It's Time for Some Changes" href="http://dougal.gunters.org/blog/2008/10/13/time-for-changes">making changes</a> to my site. This first one is going to be a little long, and I&#8217;ve been editing the draft off-and-on for over a week. Future articles will probably be shorter, in general, and focus on a particular subject. But let&#8217;s start out by looking at the current state of this website. We&#8217;ll examine what is good, what I think needs changing, and I&#8217;ll point out some recent changes I&#8217;ve already made, and why.</p>
<p>In later installments, I will begin making changes to the site, and we can examine how and why those changes were made. I hope that by following along, you will be able to learn a little something that might help you see ways to improve your own site. Below, I&#8217;ll lay out some of the topics that I will be touching on. If there is something in particular you&#8217;d like me to address, let me know, and maybe I can add it to the list.</p>
<p><span id="more-1120"></span></p>
<h3>Where we are now</h3>
<p>Currently, the base theme for the site is <a title="Sandbox theme for WordPress" href="http://www.plaintxt.org/themes/sandbox/">Sandbox</a>, which is a great &#8220;bare-bones&#8221; template to implement a <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets"><span class="caps">CSS</span></acronym> design around. Sandbox has good <acronym title="Search Engine Optimization"><span class="caps">SEO</span></acronym> (Search Engine Optimization)  features, well-structured semantic <acronym title="HyperText Markup Language"><span class="caps">HTML</span></acronym>, <a href="http://microformats.org/">microformat</a> generation, and an excellent system of contextually generated class attributes which let you style your site using <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets"><span class="caps">CSS</span></acronym> based on a wide variety of factors for the page a visitor is currently viewing. Which is a complicated way of saying that it generates lots of classes in the <acronym title="HyperText Markup Language"><span class="caps">HTML</span></acronym> that you can use to do fancy things in your stylesheets.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also been using several plugins to add minor improvements here and there. Some of the main plugins are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/search-everything/">Search Everything</a> &#8212; extends the default WordPress search to include pages and comments</li>
<li><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/easygravatars/">Easy Gravatars</a> &#8212; my own plugin, adds Gravatars to comments without modifying the theme files</li>
<li><a href="http://sharethis.com/">ShareThis</a> &#8212; allows visitors to easily share my links on popular social networking sites like Delicious and Reddit</li>
<li><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/simple-tags/">Simple Tags</a> &#8212; extra tag management features, tag cloud</li>
<li><a href="http://txfx.net/code/wordpress/subscribe-to-comments/">Subscribe to Comments</a> &#8212; allow visitors to subscribe to post comments via email</li>
<li><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/twitter-tools/">Twitter Tools</a> &#8212; display my latest Twitter updates in my sidebar</li>
<li><a href="http://www.bencoleman.co.uk/flickr-widget-plugin-for-your-wordpress-sidebar/">Flickr Badge Widget</a> &#8212; display random photos from my Flickr photo stream</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, some of these plugins are &#8220;decorative&#8221; in nature (Easy Gravatars, Twitter Tools, Flickr Badge). Others are to improve the site&#8217;s usability to visitors (Search Everything), others are to encourage &#8220;stickiness&#8221; (Subscribe to Comments, ShareThis). And there are plugins to make things easier for me, the site owner (Simple Tags).</p>
<p>I use many more plugins than those listed above (nearly 40 all together), but that list will give you an idea of some of the more visible ones, and why I use them.</p>
<h3>A few personal touches</h3>
<p>For some features, I either couldn&#8217;t find an existing plugin that worked like I wanted, or the plugins I found were overkill for my purposes. I wanted to avoid modifying template files in the same way that you want to avoid modifying core WordPress files. So one thing I&#8217;ve done is to create a special plugin called &#8220;My Local Customizations&#8221;.</p>
<p>This plugin handles several things that are specific to my site, but not tied down to whatever theme I might be using. For example, it is responsible for adding in the scripts for Google Analytics and other traffic metric services, adds extra metadata to my pages, adds a &#8220;related posts&#8221; section (aided by the Simple Tags plugin), and it defines a customized &#8220;nice_excerpt&#8221; function that some of my archive pages use. I&#8217;ll probably give more details about nice excerpts in a future article.</p>
<h3>Room for improvement</h3>
<p>For some time now, I&#8217;ve been using the &#8220;Rockem Sockem Robots&#8221; image for my &#8220;branding&#8221;. There was no particular reason for choosing it, other than I had taken the photo, and wanted to use it for something. In a long-ago redesign of my site, I stuck it in my header, and began using the robot image as my avatar shortly afterwards. The robot branding is fun and fine for small-scale personal usage, but if I ever want to have personal branding that I could use for business purposes, I would start running up against trademark issues. As a result, I am planning to phase out the robot images, but I haven&#8217;t settled on a definite replacement yet.</p>
<p>In the earlier days of my site, I generally assumed that most of my visitors were pretty tech-savvy, and could find ways to keep up-to-date with my site on their own, if they wanted to. However, the blogosphere has changed since then, and I can&#8217;t always assume that someone who wishes to subscribe to my site knows how to let their tools find my syndication feeds, or knows to look around for a &#8220;subscribe by email&#8221; link. I need to do some work to bring these subscription options in front of people&#8217;s eyeballs, make them easy to find, so that I can make it easier for visitors to subscribe to, and revisit my site. Expect to see prominent subscription icons appear soon.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve got several stand-alone pages such as &#8220;<a href="http://dougal.gunters.org/about-this-site">About This Site</a>&#8220;, &#8220;<a href="http://dougal.gunters.org/contact">Contact</a>&#8220;, &#8220;<a href="http://dougal.gunters.org/donate">Donate</a>&#8220;, and &#8220;<a href="http://dougal.gunters.org/tagcloud">Tag Cloud</a>&#8220;. The About page has some information about me and this site, but I&#8217;m really not very happy with its current state. Likewise with the Contact and Donate pages: they are very basic, sometimes cluttered, and not terribly interesting. I&#8217;ll be touching those up somewhere along the way in this series of articles.</p>
<p>Though I&#8217;ve created several plugins for WordPress, I haven&#8217;t done a lot to promote them, beyond announcing them and making occasional updates. There are several improvements I can make to help improve the visibility of those projects. For one thing, I will move them from posts to pages. Then I will create a special page template which will automatically include download links, a &#8220;call to action&#8221; for donations, and changelog information. I will also create a consolidated &#8220;projects&#8221; page which will list all of the projects, to make them easier to find.</p>
<p>My sidebar is a cluttered, badly-organized mess. There are too many links, several of which are probably out of date. Many of the external links should be removed from the sidebar, and moved to a separate &#8220;resources&#8221; page. The sidebar will be reduced to primarily contain links with more information about myself, this site, and a few key external resources which are important to me (likely in the form of some kind of lifestream). I will also make context-sensitive sidebars, so that different sections will appear depending on whether you are viewing the home page, a single blog post, a plugin project page, archive pages, etc.</p>
<p>My categories are also in a state of disarray. Back before we had real tag support in WordPress, I began using categories as tags. After we got tags in the core system, I began to regret that decision. As I&#8217;ve posted before, there are valid reasons to use both <a href="http://dougal.gunters.org/blog/2007/09/22/tags-and-categories-in-wordpress">categories and tags</a>, for separate organizational purposes. I plan to slim down to a very small set of broad categories, with tags providing supplemental keyword metadata. In order to preserve any existing category <acronym title="Uniform Resource Locator"><span class="caps">URL</span></acronym> pointers, this will require me to create some sort of redirection from the old categories to new tag archive URLs. This will likely be done in a custom 404 handler in the new theme, when I reach that stage of my redesign. Once I finish reaping the categories, I plan to give posts in each category a unique visual identity, by means of a standard icon for each one, and possibly a unique color scheme variation. This will make it easier for visitors to pick out the topics that interest them the most when skimming the site.</p>
<p>Currently, I am using a very standard blog format &#8212; a header, sidebar, and a main content area containing ten posts. In the long  term, I plan to switch to a format more closely resembling an online magazine. The main content area will call more attention to just the most recent few articles, with just linked headlines to some of the less recent ones. I will probably switch from Sandbox to some other base theme, and modify it  to my needs. More on that later, when I make more decisions about how I want to arrange things.</p>
<h3>Most recent changes</h3>
<p>Even though change here has been slow, I have made a few improvements and additions recently. For example, I set up my feeds with FeedBurner and installed the FeedSmith plugin. For one thing, this finally gives me some idea about how many <acronym title="Rich Site Summary"><span class="caps">RSS</span></acronym>/Atom subscribers I have, about 500 &#8212; more than I thought, not as many as I would like. I will be doing more with this, such as using FeedBurner&#8217;s Email Subscription service so that visitors can receive site updates by email. I also installed the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/all-in-one-seo-pack/">All in One <acronym title="Search Engine Optimization"><span class="caps">SEO</span></acronym> Pack</a> plugin, which makes several good <acronym title="Search Engine Optimization"><span class="caps">SEO</span></acronym> improvements right out of the box. I installed the <a href="http://www.preblogging.com/increase-sociability/">Increase Sociability</a> plugin, which recognizes when a visitor arrives from Digg or StumbleUpon, and gives them an additional &#8220;call to action&#8221; to help share my site with others. And I began trying out the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/drain-hole/">Drain Hole</a> plugin (on my post about the <a href="http://dougal.gunters.org/blog/2008/08/29/xcache-object-cache-plugin-for-wordpress-25">XCache object-cache plugin</a>), which is a precursor to the plugin page improvements I mentioned above.</p>
<h3>Stay tuned&#8230;</h3>
<p>So there is my &#8220;State of the Blog&#8221; update, and a rough plan for how I know I can improve my site. I&#8217;m no designer, but I&#8217;ll do my best to make the site not only function better, but to look better. Again, I hope that some of you will learn something as I progress, and if you have your own ideas that you think will improve the site, feel free to toss them into the pot!</p>";s:7:"pubdate";s:31:"Wed, 15 Oct 2008 11:00:38 +0000";s:2:"dc";a:1:{s:7:"creator";s:6:"Dougal";}s:7:"summary";s:12378:"<p><a href="http://dougal.gunters.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/wordpress-wednesday.png"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1150" title="WordPress Wednesday" src="http://dougal.gunters.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/wordpress-wednesday.png" alt="" width="200" height="200" /></a></p>
<p>This is the first installment of &#8220;WordPress Wednesday&#8221;, which I mentioned in my previous post about <a title="It's Time for Some Changes" href="http://dougal.gunters.org/blog/2008/10/13/time-for-changes">making changes</a> to my site. This first one is going to be a little long, and I&#8217;ve been editing the draft off-and-on for over a week. Future articles will probably be shorter, in general, and focus on a particular subject. But let&#8217;s start out by looking at the current state of this website. We&#8217;ll examine what is good, what I think needs changing, and I&#8217;ll point out some recent changes I&#8217;ve already made, and why.</p>
<p>In later installments, I will begin making changes to the site, and we can examine how and why those changes were made. I hope that by following along, you will be able to learn a little something that might help you see ways to improve your own site. Below, I&#8217;ll lay out some of the topics that I will be touching on. If there is something in particular you&#8217;d like me to address, let me know, and maybe I can add it to the list.</p>
<p><span id="more-1120"></span></p>
<h3>Where we are now</h3>
<p>Currently, the base theme for the site is <a title="Sandbox theme for WordPress" href="http://www.plaintxt.org/themes/sandbox/">Sandbox</a>, which is a great &#8220;bare-bones&#8221; template to implement a <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets"><span class="caps">CSS</span></acronym> design around. Sandbox has good <acronym title="Search Engine Optimization"><span class="caps">SEO</span></acronym> (Search Engine Optimization)  features, well-structured semantic <acronym title="HyperText Markup Language"><span class="caps">HTML</span></acronym>, <a href="http://microformats.org/">microformat</a> generation, and an excellent system of contextually generated class attributes which let you style your site using <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets"><span class="caps">CSS</span></acronym> based on a wide variety of factors for the page a visitor is currently viewing. Which is a complicated way of saying that it generates lots of classes in the <acronym title="HyperText Markup Language"><span class="caps">HTML</span></acronym> that you can use to do fancy things in your stylesheets.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also been using several plugins to add minor improvements here and there. Some of the main plugins are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/search-everything/">Search Everything</a> &#8212; extends the default WordPress search to include pages and comments</li>
<li><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/easygravatars/">Easy Gravatars</a> &#8212; my own plugin, adds Gravatars to comments without modifying the theme files</li>
<li><a href="http://sharethis.com/">ShareThis</a> &#8212; allows visitors to easily share my links on popular social networking sites like Delicious and Reddit</li>
<li><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/simple-tags/">Simple Tags</a> &#8212; extra tag management features, tag cloud</li>
<li><a href="http://txfx.net/code/wordpress/subscribe-to-comments/">Subscribe to Comments</a> &#8212; allow visitors to subscribe to post comments via email</li>
<li><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/twitter-tools/">Twitter Tools</a> &#8212; display my latest Twitter updates in my sidebar</li>
<li><a href="http://www.bencoleman.co.uk/flickr-widget-plugin-for-your-wordpress-sidebar/">Flickr Badge Widget</a> &#8212; display random photos from my Flickr photo stream</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, some of these plugins are &#8220;decorative&#8221; in nature (Easy Gravatars, Twitter Tools, Flickr Badge). Others are to improve the site&#8217;s usability to visitors (Search Everything), others are to encourage &#8220;stickiness&#8221; (Subscribe to Comments, ShareThis). And there are plugins to make things easier for me, the site owner (Simple Tags).</p>
<p>I use many more plugins than those listed above (nearly 40 all together), but that list will give you an idea of some of the more visible ones, and why I use them.</p>
<h3>A few personal touches</h3>
<p>For some features, I either couldn&#8217;t find an existing plugin that worked like I wanted, or the plugins I found were overkill for my purposes. I wanted to avoid modifying template files in the same way that you want to avoid modifying core WordPress files. So one thing I&#8217;ve done is to create a special plugin called &#8220;My Local Customizations&#8221;.</p>
<p>This plugin handles several things that are specific to my site, but not tied down to whatever theme I might be using. For example, it is responsible for adding in the scripts for Google Analytics and other traffic metric services, adds extra metadata to my pages, adds a &#8220;related posts&#8221; section (aided by the Simple Tags plugin), and it defines a customized &#8220;nice_excerpt&#8221; function that some of my archive pages use. I&#8217;ll probably give more details about nice excerpts in a future article.</p>
<h3>Room for improvement</h3>
<p>For some time now, I&#8217;ve been using the &#8220;Rockem Sockem Robots&#8221; image for my &#8220;branding&#8221;. There was no particular reason for choosing it, other than I had taken the photo, and wanted to use it for something. In a long-ago redesign of my site, I stuck it in my header, and began using the robot image as my avatar shortly afterwards. The robot branding is fun and fine for small-scale personal usage, but if I ever want to have personal branding that I could use for business purposes, I would start running up against trademark issues. As a result, I am planning to phase out the robot images, but I haven&#8217;t settled on a definite replacement yet.</p>
<p>In the earlier days of my site, I generally assumed that most of my visitors were pretty tech-savvy, and could find ways to keep up-to-date with my site on their own, if they wanted to. However, the blogosphere has changed since then, and I can&#8217;t always assume that someone who wishes to subscribe to my site knows how to let their tools find my syndication feeds, or knows to look around for a &#8220;subscribe by email&#8221; link. I need to do some work to bring these subscription options in front of people&#8217;s eyeballs, make them easy to find, so that I can make it easier for visitors to subscribe to, and revisit my site. Expect to see prominent subscription icons appear soon.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve got several stand-alone pages such as &#8220;<a href="http://dougal.gunters.org/about-this-site">About This Site</a>&#8220;, &#8220;<a href="http://dougal.gunters.org/contact">Contact</a>&#8220;, &#8220;<a href="http://dougal.gunters.org/donate">Donate</a>&#8220;, and &#8220;<a href="http://dougal.gunters.org/tagcloud">Tag Cloud</a>&#8220;. The About page has some information about me and this site, but I&#8217;m really not very happy with its current state. Likewise with the Contact and Donate pages: they are very basic, sometimes cluttered, and not terribly interesting. I&#8217;ll be touching those up somewhere along the way in this series of articles.</p>
<p>Though I&#8217;ve created several plugins for WordPress, I haven&#8217;t done a lot to promote them, beyond announcing them and making occasional updates. There are several improvements I can make to help improve the visibility of those projects. For one thing, I will move them from posts to pages. Then I will create a special page template which will automatically include download links, a &#8220;call to action&#8221; for donations, and changelog information. I will also create a consolidated &#8220;projects&#8221; page which will list all of the projects, to make them easier to find.</p>
<p>My sidebar is a cluttered, badly-organized mess. There are too many links, several of which are probably out of date. Many of the external links should be removed from the sidebar, and moved to a separate &#8220;resources&#8221; page. The sidebar will be reduced to primarily contain links with more information about myself, this site, and a few key external resources which are important to me (likely in the form of some kind of lifestream). I will also make context-sensitive sidebars, so that different sections will appear depending on whether you are viewing the home page, a single blog post, a plugin project page, archive pages, etc.</p>
<p>My categories are also in a state of disarray. Back before we had real tag support in WordPress, I began using categories as tags. After we got tags in the core system, I began to regret that decision. As I&#8217;ve posted before, there are valid reasons to use both <a href="http://dougal.gunters.org/blog/2007/09/22/tags-and-categories-in-wordpress">categories and tags</a>, for separate organizational purposes. I plan to slim down to a very small set of broad categories, with tags providing supplemental keyword metadata. In order to preserve any existing category <acronym title="Uniform Resource Locator"><span class="caps">URL</span></acronym> pointers, this will require me to create some sort of redirection from the old categories to new tag archive URLs. This will likely be done in a custom 404 handler in the new theme, when I reach that stage of my redesign. Once I finish reaping the categories, I plan to give posts in each category a unique visual identity, by means of a standard icon for each one, and possibly a unique color scheme variation. This will make it easier for visitors to pick out the topics that interest them the most when skimming the site.</p>
<p>Currently, I am using a very standard blog format &#8212; a header, sidebar, and a main content area containing ten posts. In the long  term, I plan to switch to a format more closely resembling an online magazine. The main content area will call more attention to just the most recent few articles, with just linked headlines to some of the less recent ones. I will probably switch from Sandbox to some other base theme, and modify it  to my needs. More on that later, when I make more decisions about how I want to arrange things.</p>
<h3>Most recent changes</h3>
<p>Even though change here has been slow, I have made a few improvements and additions recently. For example, I set up my feeds with FeedBurner and installed the FeedSmith plugin. For one thing, this finally gives me some idea about how many <acronym title="Rich Site Summary"><span class="caps">RSS</span></acronym>/Atom subscribers I have, about 500 &#8212; more than I thought, not as many as I would like. I will be doing more with this, such as using FeedBurner&#8217;s Email Subscription service so that visitors can receive site updates by email. I also installed the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/all-in-one-seo-pack/">All in One <acronym title="Search Engine Optimization"><span class="caps">SEO</span></acronym> Pack</a> plugin, which makes several good <acronym title="Search Engine Optimization"><span class="caps">SEO</span></acronym> improvements right out of the box. I installed the <a href="http://www.preblogging.com/increase-sociability/">Increase Sociability</a> plugin, which recognizes when a visitor arrives from Digg or StumbleUpon, and gives them an additional &#8220;call to action&#8221; to help share my site with others. And I began trying out the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/drain-hole/">Drain Hole</a> plugin (on my post about the <a href="http://dougal.gunters.org/blog/2008/08/29/xcache-object-cache-plugin-for-wordpress-25">XCache object-cache plugin</a>), which is a precursor to the plugin page improvements I mentioned above.</p>
<h3>Stay tuned&#8230;</h3>
<p>So there is my &#8220;State of the Blog&#8221; update, and a rough plan for how I know I can improve my site. I&#8217;m no designer, but I&#8217;ll do my best to make the site not only function better, but to look better. Again, I hope that some of you will learn something as I progress, and if you have your own ideas that you think will improve the site, feel free to toss them into the pot!</p>";}i:14;a:7:{s:5:"title";s:18:"Matt: Berlin Day 5";s:4:"guid";s:20:"http://ma.tt/?p=8165";s:4:"link";s:34:"http://ma.tt/2008/10/berlin-day-5/";s:11:"description";s:12680:"<p>Final day in Berlin.</p>

I will also make more subtle design changes, like tweaks to fonts, text size, colors, etc., as well.</p>

<p>While you should blog about them and support sponsors of WordCamp and WordPress Events, there is a bigger benefit to being a WordCamp sponsor. The rewards are invaluable, going way beyond just links!</p>
<p>As you plan your WordCamp event, Hawaii is a prime example to follow. Look at the list below carefully.</p>
<p>Most WordCamp organizers I&#8217;ve worked with stick with &#8220;known&#8221; sponsors related to blogging and web technology. While Hawaii includes many web tech companies as sponsors, they&#8217;ve reached out beyond to travel and tourist industries, Johnson and Johnson (known more for health care products than blogging), hotels, advertising and marketing agencies, and even a center for disability studies. This is a prize example of being <em>inclusive</em> rather than exclusive with a WordPress or tech event.</p>
<p>Why wouldn&#8217;t your attendees be interested in more than just web tech companies? While our blogs are dependent upon host servers, video services, podcast services, and search engines, why not be inclusive to a wide variety of industries to help promote and cover the financial burden of your event? </p>
<p>Bloggers blog about anything and everything. They also have niches such as sports blogging, medical blogging, political blogging, science blogging, home and garden blogging, knitting blogging, bowling blogging - why not help them connect with representatives of their interests?</p>
<p>These businesses also have a lot to learn about the social web and <em>want and need</em> connections with bloggers and social media experienced experts. </p>

They caught the attention of many of the attendees and other sponsors because they were there to learn, not sell. They didn&#8217;t have anything to offer bloggers or blog businesses. Yet, they brought their portable cement mixer to the Las Vegas Exhibition Hall along with their bight neon yellow t-shirts, business cards, and brochures. Why?</p>
<p>Tom and Bruce came to the event with minds and hearts open. They knew they had to get into this &#8220;social media stuff&#8221; and they had to learn hard and fast. They have a national franchise and network that connects construction experts with jobs and jobs with construction experts and equipment, in addition to providing concrete and construction equipment. With the changing economy, they know they have to work harder within the new virtual economy with this new &#8220;social thing&#8221; to get the exposure and connections they need. </p>
<p>Not knowing where to turn for a fast education in the new social media, they paid their way into the biggest meeting of social media experts: <em>bloggers</em>.</p>
<p>Think about this. If they wanted to learn about online social networking and capital, they could have bought a book. They could have turned to someone in their home town who may or may not have the experience they needed, paid them a little money, and be no better off than they were. They could cast a wide net and spend a lot of time interviewing so called &#8220;social media experts&#8221; in marketing, public relations, and web development, and still outlaid a lot of cash, but with no basis to help them decide who is the right expert for their business, it&#8217;s money paid without faith in a return. </p>

<p>When you prepare yourself to talk to potential sponsors, use Cart-Away Concrete as your example. By being surrounded with bloggers and social media experts who were fascinated by the total incongruity of a cement mixer being at a blogging conference, they won. They also won by being with business people who admitted, &#8220;Hey, we don&#8217;t know what you do but we want to be a part of it. You know how to do this. Tell us what you know.&#8221; </p>
<p>Who wouldn&#8217;t love that!</p>
<p>Few booths attracted the attention these two guys did. Even if no one was talking to them, they were talking about them throughout the conference. &#8220;Hey, did you see that cement mixer? What is a cement mixer doing at a blog conference? Instead of selling me something, these guys wanted me to sell them on blogging. Go figure!&#8221;</p>
<p>What more could a sponsor want?</p>

<p>I&#8217;m excited about this packed week in Hawaii and I&#8217;m there to learn as much as to share with others. Hawaii is a hot bed of diversity issues and cultural clashes, and no where to escape from them. They have had to learn to live together as the cultures crossed borders and combined. </p>
<p>With the world crossing borders every day on the web, we have a lot to learn from the lessons of social interaction and conflict management that Hawaii lives every day as proof of the possible. Expect a lot of lessons on what I learned coming to you over the next few months from my Hawaiian social experiences.</p>

<h2>News:</h2>
<p> WordPress 2.7 is nearing feature freeze. Once that happens, we should start to see announcements in the dashboard regarding beta releases. Based on everything I have read, 2.7 is on schedule to be released on November 10th. If something major is discovered during the beta trials, the date of release will obviously be changed.</p>
<p>Didn&#8217;t get the chance to mention this on the show but I wanted to pass along a happy birthday to <a href="http://www.hackwordpress.com" target="_blank">HackWordPress.com</a> as they have turned 1 year old.</p>

<h2>Plugin Of The Week:</h2>
<p><strong>Jeff -</strong> <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/exclude-pages/" target="_blank">Exclude Pages</a> – This plugin adds a checkbox, “include this page in menus”, which is checked by default. If you uncheck it, the page will not appear in any listings of pages (which includes, and is usually limited to, your page navigation menus). Pages which are children of excluded pages also do not show up in menu listings. (An alert in the editing screen, underneath the &#8220;include&#8221; checkbox allows you to track down which ancestor page is affecting child pages in this way.) You could do this just as easily by adding exclusion arguments to the WP_LIST_PAGES function but this plugin takes those steps out of the process.</p>
<h2>WordPress Job Of The Week:</h2>
<p> This job was published on <a href="http://jobs.wordpress.net/2008/10/10/upgrade-from-21-to-current-wp-version-plugins/">October 10th on the WeblogToolsCollection.com Job board</a>. Sure Foods Living is looking for someone who can upgrade WordPress 2.1 to the current version. The individual at one point had someone to help them customize their site but that person is no longer available. Also, because of the upgrade, this person needs to change templates since the current one is not compatible with the latest version of WordPress. The potential client is asking for people who are qualified and for quotes on how much this project would cost. If you are interested in this job, please contact alison at surefoodsliving.com</p>
<h2>Announcements:</h2>
<p> <a href="http://jane.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Jane Wells</a> who works for Automattic in the user experience/usability department will be our special one hour guest on Halloween night. That is <strong>Friday, October 31st</strong>, 2008. So if you&#8217;re interested in talking usability in WordPress, definitely mark this date on your calendar. </p>

<p>Gravatar has come a long way from the service that it was back in October 2007.  My wife likes to laugh at me because I&#8217;ll pick something up in one room, like a remote control, and move around the house fidgeting with it.  Then I&#8217;ll absentmindedly leave it in some random place like the bathroom, or the freezer.  One year ago we picked up a small avatar service with a great name and an awesome fan base.  Now, in an attempt not to leave it in a random location, we&#8217;re looking back on the last year (and letting you look with us.)</p>
<p>The service was running version 2.0, and set up on two rented (or collocated, I don&#8217;t honestly know) servers.  The servers were running at loads of around 20, and could spike to well over 100 (that&#8217;s a lot.)  It was obvious that we needed both some stop-gap fixes and a plan. The first thing we did was throw some caching servers in front of the service &#8212; a couple of varnish servers as I recall.  This dropped the workload of the two boxes considerably, and allowed us to look at Gravatar without bringing the service down.  Next we replicated the setup 1 for 1 to two of our own (more powerful) servers.  This gave us a bit more breathing room.  And we began to plan.</p>
<p>It was obvious, from the very beginning that the service was going to have to handle a constant torrent of requests from the internet.  Most of those requests would be for email addresses with no Gravatar and come from URLs that could be crafted in an unlimited number of ways.  On top of that we knew that we wanted to make all the paid features free, and expand the size a Gravatar could be from 80 pixels to 512 pixels.  So basically instead of our goals being to make the undertaking less daunting we we&#8217;re actively making it a more intense challenge than it could have been.  But that was OK with us, because our goals for Gravatar weren&#8217;t to make it easier but to make it better.  We wanted to make Gravatar the kind of free service that we could use, would want to use, and would be proud to share with the world.  I know that last bit sounds like marketing crap, but that&#8217;s really what we wanted to do and is really how we look at Gravatar.</p>
<p>Pretty much the next thing we did was port Gravatars code from RoR (Ruby on Rails) to PHP.  As I mentioned when we announced this change the reason for this wasn&#8217;t about Ruby or Rails.  Simply put we&#8217;re a PHP shop, and once rewritten in PHP we have many more great minds that we can easily throw at it than if it were still in RoR. Since we ported it *pretty much* directly from rails there are some left-over rails-isms in Gravatars code that you wont find in, say, WordPress. Shh&#8230;. Don&#8217;t tell Matt <img src="http://s.wordpress.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
<p>In the rewriting we tried to tackle the largest scalability problems with the design of the service.  You can imagine that for an avatar serving service&#8230; storing, searching, and serving avatars is paramount.  Gravatar 2.0 (pre PHP) suffered from some pretty significant inefficiencies in this regard, and I think that a big part of that was limited resources (time and servers.)  Luckily we we&#8217;re now not significantly limited by either of those things.</p>
<p>&#8211; warning beginning technical details which may be safely skipped over if you don&#8217;t care &#8211;</p>
<p>The way that images were stored originally was: a complete image was made for all sizes between 1&#215;1 and 80&#215;80 pixels, a directory made for each rating, and a symlink placed from the rating to the appropriate image (either the users image or the default image in case the rating was too high.)  So that&#8217;s 80 images, 5 directories, and 240 symbolic links.  The reason for this, I believe, was to attempt to serve the avatar content without any database interaction whatever.  The files were then archived, uploaded to Amazon S3, and an entry added to Amazon SQS.  Finally the SQS entry was retrieved by the serving server, the file downloaded, extracted, and placed on the filesystem.  So this is why it took several minutes once you uploaded and cropped your image for you to be able to browse the rest of the site again.  You can imagine how many files Gravatar was comprised of by the time we got a hold of it!  We knew that this would simply NOT work for our new 512&#215;512px avatar sizes.  Lastly there were a couple of directories which had several hundred thousand entries (either files or other directories) which were nearly impossible to even get a listing inside of.  So we had a list of things NOT to do.  We just needed to figure out what TO do <img src="http://s.wordpress.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
<p>So we decided that we would render all our avatars dynamically from the highest quality copy of the image we can manage&#8230; down.  We would only store one version of the image, though we would store it in multiple places (a local file server for speed, and S3 for redundancy.)  We would still rely heavily on caching.  And we would asynchronize as much of the workload as was possible, so that you don&#8217;t have to wait for things to happen after you finish cropping (to do this we employed various techniques and hacks best left for another day and another story.)</p>
<p>&#8211; ok this batch of details has been concluded &#8211;</p>
<p>So the problems were many, one year ago, and the challenges were fascinating.  I recall being overwhelmed by support requests for quite some time.  I would get 40 emails on a good day, more on a bad.  And believe it or not your emails very much shaped the future of Gravatar.  I would group them into specific problems, and always fix at least the largest problem (volume wise) each week.  Over time the service has grown quite stable, support requests have gone down to just a handful every day, and things are generally peppier than ever.</p>
<p>We had some some bumps tuning our caches&#8230; for a while there we accidentally told your web browsers never EVER to re-validate an image. But we got that handled in short order&#8230; and things are zipping along quite nicely.</p>
<p>Gravatar now lives on about 20 servers: 2 Database servers, 1 File server, 2 Load balancers, 5 Caching servers, 9 Web servers, and 1 Development server.  That combination of servers is handling an average of 7,214 of your requests every second of every day.  That&#8217;s a whopping 623,293,056 requests daily! 96% of all of those requests are served directly from cache.  These days we get around 5,000 uploaded images every day.  Even with this staggering increase in the number of requests we&#8217;ve been able to make Gravatar faster, and more reliable than it&#8217;s ever been.</p>
<p>So here we are, one year later, looking out over the vast frontier of the internet and contemplating the future of Gravatar.  There are a great many things that it could become.  We know that we don&#8217;t want to loose focus on the core of the project: Serving your avatars (that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s all about!)</p>
<p>We know that an avatar is &#8220;a graphical image that represents a person, as on the Internet,&#8221;  But it&#8217;s also &#8220;an embodiment or personification, as of a principle, attitude, or view of life.&#8221;  And that is exactly where we are headed:  Making Gravatar a place where you can do more than just store an image, making it a place that can be your presence online.  So we&#8217;ll be rolling out more features in the near future to allow you to store more data inside Gravatar &#8212; and more importantly to allow you to use that information in other places on the internet through open standards.</p>
<p>We hope that you&#8217;ve had as awesome a time using your Gravatars as we&#8217;ve had making it all work.  And we look forward to the future &#8212; to when your identity doesn&#8217;t have to be cemented to a specific site, but is fluid and flexible, and persistent.  We hope to see you there!</p>

<p>Gravatar has come a long way from the service that it was back in October 2007.  My wife likes to laugh at me because I&#8217;ll pick something up in one room, like a remote control, and move around the house fidgeting with it.  Then I&#8217;ll absentmindedly leave it in some random place like the bathroom, or the freezer.  One year ago we picked up a small avatar service with a great name and an awesome fan base.  Now, in an attempt not to leave it in a random location, we&#8217;re looking back on the last year (and letting you look with us.)</p>
<p>The service was running version 2.0, and set up on two rented (or collocated, I don&#8217;t honestly know) servers.  The servers were running at loads of around 20, and could spike to well over 100 (that&#8217;s a lot.)  It was obvious that we needed both some stop-gap fixes and a plan. The first thing we did was throw some caching servers in front of the service &#8212; a couple of varnish servers as I recall.  This dropped the workload of the two boxes considerably, and allowed us to look at Gravatar without bringing the service down.  Next we replicated the setup 1 for 1 to two of our own (more powerful) servers.  This gave us a bit more breathing room.  And we began to plan.</p>
<p>It was obvious, from the very beginning that the service was going to have to handle a constant torrent of requests from the internet.  Most of those requests would be for email addresses with no Gravatar and come from URLs that could be crafted in an unlimited number of ways.  On top of that we knew that we wanted to make all the paid features free, and expand the size a Gravatar could be from 80 pixels to 512 pixels.  So basically instead of our goals being to make the undertaking less daunting we we&#8217;re actively making it a more intense challenge than it could have been.  But that was OK with us, because our goals for Gravatar weren&#8217;t to make it easier but to make it better.  We wanted to make Gravatar the kind of free service that we could use, would want to use, and would be proud to share with the world.  I know that last bit sounds like marketing crap, but that&#8217;s really what we wanted to do and is really how we look at Gravatar.</p>
<p>Pretty much the next thing we did was port Gravatars code from RoR (Ruby on Rails) to PHP.  As I mentioned when we announced this change the reason for this wasn&#8217;t about Ruby or Rails.  Simply put we&#8217;re a PHP shop, and once rewritten in PHP we have many more great minds that we can easily throw at it than if it were still in RoR. Since we ported it *pretty much* directly from rails there are some left-over rails-isms in Gravatars code that you wont find in, say, WordPress. Shh&#8230;. Don&#8217;t tell Matt <img src="http://s.wordpress.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
<p>In the rewriting we tried to tackle the largest scalability problems with the design of the service.  You can imagine that for an avatar serving service&#8230; storing, searching, and serving avatars is paramount.  Gravatar 2.0 (pre PHP) suffered from some pretty significant inefficiencies in this regard, and I think that a big part of that was limited resources (time and servers.)  Luckily we we&#8217;re now not significantly limited by either of those things.</p>

WP Super Cache is a page caching plugin for WordPress that will significantly speed up your website.</p>
<h3>Double Caching</h3>
<p>This releases fixes a long standing compression bug. In older versions of the plugin, the cached page was compressed twice. Once to display to the current visitor, and once again for the cached files stored on the server. This has now been fixed and there&#8217;s a noticeable speed increase for anonymous visitors. Unfortunately as a side effect, it&#8217;s not possible to display the &#8220;super cache gz&#8221; html comment now. To verify that html pages are being served from the supercache directory you&#8217;ll have to add an error_log() somewhere and check that visits <em>aren&#8217;t</em> logged.<br />
The plugin now uses fopen() instead of gzopen() which according to <a href="http://ie2.php.net/manual/en/function.gzopen.php#85561">a comment</a> on the gzopen() manual page is unreliable under high load.</p>
<h3>IE7 Fixes</h3>
<p>Apparently IE7 has problems when gzipped files are served as &#8220;x-gzip&#8221; files, under certain circumstances. This is an obscure bug but this has been fixed. If you&#8217;re upgrading, either remove wp-content/cache/.htaccess and visit the admin page and that file will be regenerated, or edit that file and change &#8220;x-gzip&#8221; to &#8220;gzip&#8221;.</p>
<p>A number of smaller bugs were also fixed. Check the <a href="http://svn.wp-plugins.org/wp-super-cache/trunk/Changelog.txt">changelog</a> for further info.</p>

<p>Over the weekend, I happened to come across a post written by <a href="http://www.wp-fun.co.uk/2008/10/01/unobtrusive-config-for-fire-and-forget-plugins/" target="_blank">Andrew Rickmann</a> which showcased an idea to create a <strong>configure</strong> link next next to the usual <strong>Activate/Deactivate Edit</strong> links found within the Plugin Management panel.</p>
<p><a href="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/b2-img/2008/10/configurelink.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4313" title="configurelink" src="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/b2-img/2008/10/configurelink.png" alt="" width="243" height="98" /></a></p>
<p>Andrew&#8217;s point of view is that, instead of adding top level menu items to the WordPress administration panels, it would be far easier to click on a configure link that would open up a sliding panel which would present anywhere from 1-5 configurable settings. Not only does this idea make configuring plugins faster, but it makes browsing the WordPress administration panel much easier as the top level navigation system is not filled with links. On top of that, the configure link makes complete sense to be located next to the Deactivate/Edit links. In doing so, configuration options are in a predictable location.</p>
<p><a href="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/b2-img/2008/10/configureinaction.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4314" title="configureinaction" src="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/b2-img/2008/10/configureinaction.png" alt="" width="500" height="115" /></a></p>
<p>In my opinion, here are a couple of reasons why we are not seeing something like this already being used. Number one, WordPress is open source meaning anytime you try to implement anything close to a standard, it probably won&#8217;t work. People will come up with their own solutions to the problem which is one of the beauties of Open Source but can also be a contributing problem. Secondly, this was brought up over two years ago. You can see the <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/topic/63824?replies=13" target="_blank">initial forum thread here</a> and the post on the <a href="http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2006-March/005247.html" target="_blank">WP-Hackers Mailing List from Owen here</a>. Considering we have gone two years without any move towards a solution such as the one Andrew suggested, perhaps we will always be at the mercy as to where plugin authors place their configuration links.</p>
<p>Plugin authors can bring up the fact that they provide directions within their readme files that indicate where to find the configuration page. While they may help in the short term, that doesn&#8217;t solve the root of the overall problem. Andrew&#8217;s idea is something that can be implemented by plugin authors right now. In terms of something like this being added to the core, according to Andrew, the process is so simple, it probably doesn&#8217;t need to be added.</p>

<p>Instead of getting into the code, I talked about techniques and approaches, and different kinds of plugins.

We may change this at <a href="http://denver.wordcamp.org" rel="external">WordCamp Denver</a> and have some technical presentations.</p>
<p>I also announced a couple of goodies at the end of the talk. We pulled an all-nighter on Friday getting everything ready for release. My presentation might have suffered a bit as a result. <img src="http://alexking.org/wp/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
<p>We&#8217;ve released some <a href="http://crowdfavorite.com/wordpress/#tools">development tools</a> for other WordPress developers to use. These are things we&#8217;ve had to build over the years, and thought others could make good use of.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>WordPress Install (SVN Checkout) Script</strong> - a shell script will walk you through a checkout of multiple versions of WordPress from SVN and set up the requisite config file and database structure. This makes it easy to create a series of installs for testing purposes.</li>
<li><strong>WordPress Compatibility Plugin</strong> - sets some constants and some other little things that provide backward compatibility for older versions of WordPress.</li>
<li><strong>Quality Assurance (QA) Checklists</strong> - checklists to help guide plugin and theme testing. Includes considerations such as WordPress version, theme compatibility, browser type, WordPress settings, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>The biggest announcement - and the one I&#8217;m most excited about - was the <a href="http://carringtontheme.com">Carrington theme</a>, but I&#8217;ll have a follow-up post about that as there is just too much to cover here.</p>
<p>Thanks again to everyone who made WordCamp Utah a success.</p>
<p>UPDATE: Oh yeah, the presentation was recorded. (Thanks <a href="http://www.crawlspacemedia.com/blog/2008/10/06/carrington-theme/" rel="external">Jeremy</a>)</p>

Enjoy.</p>
<p><strong>5. Speaking of child themes and theme frameworks, can you explain how one would upgrade a child theme when a theme framework is involved?</strong></p>
<p>From the end users perspective there&#8217;s really no change in how you use a Child Theme as opposed to a regular theme and there&#8217;s really no change in how you upgrade that theme. Even if a theme framework is involved.</p>
<p>But the process of upgrading that Child Theme can be improved on. One thing I do in the pre-designed Thematic Child Themes I release commercially is add in a function that looks for a &#8220;variant.css&#8221; file in the wp-content directory. That function lets you make minor changes like adding background images and changing colors within variant.css without touching the original Child Theme CSS, making it ready to be upgraded itself without headache or incident—just like the framework it&#8217;s building on top of.</p>
<p><strong> 6. How do you see theme frameworks and child themes affecting the premium theme market?</strong></p>
<p><em>Hugely</em>. I see theme frameworks affecting the commercial theming market hugely. Frankly, if you&#8217;re making money through WordPress themes, either by selling pre-designed themes or creating custom ones for individual clients, and you haven&#8217;t taken a good hard look at using Child Themes in your business you&#8217;re wasting your time.</p>
<p>Consider this scenario: your company, or Theme Club, or who-knows-what, releases a GPL Theme Framework through the WordPress Themes Directory that the whole community can enjoy. You create a WordPress Child Theme for an individual client that builds on top of that framework, or maybe release a pre-designed Child Theme for it commercially on a Theme Club site. And because you&#8217;re awesome, money rolls in.</p>
<p>Now, when WordPress eventually changes—for the better, of course—you&#8217;re going to have to update some of that theme code. But! you&#8217;re probably only going to have to update the code in your Parent Theme—just like I mentioned in the example earlier with ThemeShaper.com and Thematic. What does that mean for your business? Because you&#8217;ve released the framework through the Themes directory every one of your clients will receive automatic notification of the upgrade and—thanks to changes in WordPress 2.7—they can download and install the upgraded theme almost instantly with the click of a button in the WordPress admin. Now, if you&#8217;re cutting theme maintenance down you&#8217;re freeing up more time to work on other areas of your business. Like, designing more Child Themes and making more money.</p>
<p>And even if you&#8217;re not releasing your theme framework through the WordPress Themes Directory, frameworks and Child Themes are still going to make your life easier. As professional WordPress theme developer Darren Hoyt says, &#8220;anyone who builds a quantity of WordPress sites throughout the year would be crazy to not already have their own baseline theme&#8221; (<a href="http://www.darrenhoyt.com/2008/09/18/exploring-wordpress-frameworks-and-child-themes/" target="_blank">http://www.darrenhoyt.com/2008/09/18/exploring-wordpress-frameworks-and-child-themes/</a>). And the easiest way to make changes to that baseline theme, while <em>treating it</em> like a real framework, is by using a Child Theme.</p>
<p><strong>7. Do you think that if this trend becomes popular, would end users see a battle between the best theme frameworks via theme authors?</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely. Everyone that&#8217;s ever released a WordPress theme knows about the warm feeling you get from people—often a lot of people—actually using your work (that&#8217;s not facetiousness, it&#8217;s one of the main reasons I think people <em>keep on</em> releasing themes). But there&#8217;s also a whole host of other benefits like increased site traffic, link building and authority in the community that provide you opportunities for making money by releasing themes for free or commercially. Sometimes a lot of money. All those benefits start to compound when you start talking about releasing a theme framework. A popular theme framework has the potential to become a self-advertising, lead-generating, service-selling machine. I think theme authors are starting to realize what that can mean for them which means, in turn, that we&#8217;ll probably soon see a whole bunch of theme frameworks popping up.</p>
<p>But really, a theme framework is just a good WordPress theme. We should <em>hope</em> there&#8217;s a battle to create the best GPL theme framework. That&#8217;s a battle where <em>everybody</em> in the WordPress community wins.</p>
<p><strong>8. Would you care to share any other knowledge or information with our readers that you would like to cover with regards to this topic?</strong></p>
<p>There&#8217;s actually a fair bit of information out there now on how to work with Child Themes. I&#8217;ve compiled a quick list of links that should give you all the information you need to get started.</p>

<p>Carrington (<a href="http://crowdfavorite.com/wordpress/#themes">http://crowdfavorite.com/wordpress/#themes</a>)</p>";s:7:"pubdate";s:31:"Sun, 05 Oct 2008 16:00:07 +0000";s:2:"dc";a:1:{s:7:"creator";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";}s:7:"summary";s:7826:"<p>This is the second part of a 2 part interview with Ian Stewart on child themes. Enjoy.</p>
<p><strong>5. Speaking of child themes and theme frameworks, can you explain how one would upgrade a child theme when a theme framework is involved?</strong></p>
<p>From the end users perspective there&#8217;s really no change in how you use a Child Theme as opposed to a regular theme and there&#8217;s really no change in how you upgrade that theme. Even if a theme framework is involved.</p>
<p>But the process of upgrading that Child Theme can be improved on. One thing I do in the pre-designed Thematic Child Themes I release commercially is add in a function that looks for a &#8220;variant.css&#8221; file in the wp-content directory. That function lets you make minor changes like adding background images and changing colors within variant.css without touching the original Child Theme CSS, making it ready to be upgraded itself without headache or incident—just like the framework it&#8217;s building on top of.</p>
<p><strong> 6. How do you see theme frameworks and child themes affecting the premium theme market?</strong></p>
<p><em>Hugely</em>. I see theme frameworks affecting the commercial theming market hugely. Frankly, if you&#8217;re making money through WordPress themes, either by selling pre-designed themes or creating custom ones for individual clients, and you haven&#8217;t taken a good hard look at using Child Themes in your business you&#8217;re wasting your time.</p>
<p>Consider this scenario: your company, or Theme Club, or who-knows-what, releases a GPL Theme Framework through the WordPress Themes Directory that the whole community can enjoy. You create a WordPress Child Theme for an individual client that builds on top of that framework, or maybe release a pre-designed Child Theme for it commercially on a Theme Club site. And because you&#8217;re awesome, money rolls in.</p>
<p>Now, when WordPress eventually changes—for the better, of course—you&#8217;re going to have to update some of that theme code. But! you&#8217;re probably only going to have to update the code in your Parent Theme—just like I mentioned in the example earlier with ThemeShaper.com and Thematic. What does that mean for your business? Because you&#8217;ve released the framework through the Themes directory every one of your clients will receive automatic notification of the upgrade and—thanks to changes in WordPress 2.7—they can download and install the upgraded theme almost instantly with the click of a button in the WordPress admin. Now, if you&#8217;re cutting theme maintenance down you&#8217;re freeing up more time to work on other areas of your business. Like, designing more Child Themes and making more money.</p>
<p>And even if you&#8217;re not releasing your theme framework through the WordPress Themes Directory, frameworks and Child Themes are still going to make your life easier. As professional WordPress theme developer Darren Hoyt says, &#8220;anyone who builds a quantity of WordPress sites throughout the year would be crazy to not already have their own baseline theme&#8221; (<a href="http://www.darrenhoyt.com/2008/09/18/exploring-wordpress-frameworks-and-child-themes/" target="_blank">http://www.darrenhoyt.com/2008/09/18/exploring-wordpress-frameworks-and-child-themes/</a>). And the easiest way to make changes to that baseline theme, while <em>treating it</em> like a real framework, is by using a Child Theme.</p>
<p><strong>7. Do you think that if this trend becomes popular, would end users see a battle between the best theme frameworks via theme authors?</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely. Everyone that&#8217;s ever released a WordPress theme knows about the warm feeling you get from people—often a lot of people—actually using your work (that&#8217;s not facetiousness, it&#8217;s one of the main reasons I think people <em>keep on</em> releasing themes).

While WordPress does change lives, blogging changes more lives. How do I connect the dots between WordPress and the life changing experience of blogging?</p>
<p><a href="http://lorelle.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/fairyblogmother-sm.jpg"><img src="http://lorelle.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/fairyblogmother-sm.jpg?w=156" alt="" title="The WordPress Fairy Blogmother in Portland, Oregon, at WordCamp Portland in her pajamas" width="156" height="300" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3073" /></a>I didn&#8217;t realize that the WordPress Community would give me the answers I needed to that question. Their inspirational answers led to the following video on how WordPress changes lives, and the creation of the WordPress Fairy Blogmother.</p>
<p>WordPress changes lives because of the community. Over and over again, people told me that WordPress changes their lives because of the people it brings into their lives. While it doesn&#8217;t really matter what blogging platform you may use, it&#8217;s the community that supports and encourages fellow WordPress users that makes the difference. Without the <a href="http://www.wordpress.org/support" title="WordPress Support Forums" rel="tag">WordPress Support Forums</a>, the incredible free WordPress Themes created by imaginative and altruistic fans, the powerful WordPress Plugins created and shared by those who saw a challenge and found a solution, and the support and willingness of WordPress users to educate others on how to use the program and make it work better - there would be no community.</p>
<p>WordPress has inspired many to learn about coding, design, web development, marketing, but also how to be a part of a community. WordPress fans are the definition of the social web. With the passion that comes with learning and sharing WordPress tips, tricks, and techniques, they&#8217;ve founded a grassroots community, which led to WordPress meetups and social gatherings, and now to WordCamps around the world. </p>
<p><img src="http://lorelle.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/lizstrauss_glenda_lorelle_bwe.jpg" alt="" title="Liz Strauss, Glenda Watson Hyatt, and Lorelle VanFossen at Blog World Expo in Las Vegas 2008" width="418" height="397" class="alignright size-full wp-image-3074" />When I attend the many business and professional conferences to speak and present programs, it&#8217;s fairly serious. I&#8217;m there for business. They are there for business. It&#8217;s serious stuff.</p>
<p>When I walk through the door of a WordCamp event, I&#8217;ve found family. We&#8217;re instantly friends. We all know each other, and if we don&#8217;t, we will within a few moments. We&#8217;re risk takers and yet communal spirits, sharing the risk together. When one person pushes WordPress, we all benefit from the results. </p>
<p>As I interviewed people and asked the WordPress Community for help in discovering how WordPress changes lives, I knew I had to put faces on the many people who&#8217;ve had their lives transformed by their involvement in WordPress. In the first half of the video, I honor those whom I&#8217;ve known for several years since early in the development of WordPress, as well as a few new friends. Many of these people have gone from interested enthusiasts to friends of WordPress to employees of <a href="http://www.automattic.com/" title="Automattic - parent company of WordPress, WordPress.com, Akismet, BuddyPress, and more" rel="tag">Automattic</a>, the parent company of WordPress. By using WordPress and being involved in the community, they&#8217;ve built their businesses and reputation as WordPress experts, and in turn, powerful forces on the web.<br />
<span id="more-3072"></span><br />
Sure, any blogging platform can do that, but there is something about Matt Mullenweg and his vision for WordPress and blogging in general that brings people together to achieve more than they could alone. This is what changes people&#8217;s lives. Together, we&#8217;re stronger with WordPress than without.</p>
<p>Enjoy all the inspirational reasons WordPress fans offered for how and why WordPress changed their lives. And don&#8217;t forget to check out <a href="http://lorelle.wordpress.com/2008/10/01/glenda-watson-hyatt-how-wordpress-changes-her-life-daily/" title="How WordPress Changes Her Life Daily">Glenda Watson Hyatt: How WordPress Changes Her Life Daily</a>, the video made especially for the finale of my presentation.</p>

<p>There are two versions of the video.

<p><strong>Fairy Blogmother:</strong> <em>Hey, is this thing on. Hey. Is this on?<br />
Is it working? It&#8217;s not working.<br />

Ah, there we go.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>* Instrumental Music &#8220;When you wish upon a star&#8221; from Pinocchio *</em></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;When you wish upon a star, makes no difference who you are.<br />
Anything your heart desires will come to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If your heart is in your dream, no request is too extreme.<br />
&#8220;When you wish upon a star, as dreamers do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fate is kind. She brings to those who love<br />
The sweet fulfillment of their secret longing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Like a bolt out of the blue, fate steps in and sees you through.<br />
&#8220;When you wish upon a star, your dreams come true.&#8221;<br />

How WordPress has changed my life? Besides getting me interviewed in the bathroom at Blog World Expo, the height of  experiences, it makes it really easy. I have some tech experience but I love the creative side. So I don&#8217;t want to deal with the hard stuff. WordPress makes it easy to do what I want to do. There are Widgets for everything. There are template for everything. It&#8217;s easy. And I can worry about everything else and not my blog.</p>

<p>At WordCamp Portland, I surprised the audience from behind, wearing my WordPress Fairy Blogmother outfit. I spoke about the points mentioned at the beginning of this article, and asked the audience to come forward with their &#8220;testimonies&#8221; on how WordPress changed their lives. I was stunned at the number of people wanting to share their stories, nearly bringing the audience, and myself, to tears. </p>
<p>You can see the video of part of the <a href="http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/744252" title="Dale Chumbley - WordCamp Portland - Lorelle VanFossen as the WordPress Fairy Blogmother">presentation by Dale Chumbley streamed live</a> from Cubespace in Portland, Oregon.</p>

Because WordPress continues to be the most accessible and disabled-user friendly blogging platform around, she has opened up her sphere of influence and network of relationships around the world as her blog allows her to &#8220;speak out&#8221; when her body won&#8217;t. </p>
<p>As we design and develop WordPress Themes, Plugins, and code, the WordPress Community needs to remember that Glenda is an important representative of our users.</p>
<p>Thank you again to everyone who helped me put this together, everyone whose lives have been touched my WordPress, and everyone who has helped changed my life with WordPress.</p>

While WordPress does change lives, blogging changes more lives. How do I connect the dots between WordPress and the life changing experience of blogging?</p>
<p><a href="http://lorelle.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/fairyblogmother-sm.jpg"><img src="http://lorelle.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/fairyblogmother-sm.jpg?w=156" alt="" title="The WordPress Fairy Blogmother in Portland, Oregon, at WordCamp Portland in her pajamas" width="156" height="300" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3073" /></a>I didn&#8217;t realize that the WordPress Community would give me the answers I needed to that question. Their inspirational answers led to the following video on how WordPress changes lives, and the creation of the WordPress Fairy Blogmother.</p>
<p>WordPress changes lives because of the community. Over and over again, people told me that WordPress changes their lives because of the people it brings into their lives. While it doesn&#8217;t really matter what blogging platform you may use, it&#8217;s the community that supports and encourages fellow WordPress users that makes the difference. Without the <a href="http://www.wordpress.org/support" title="WordPress Support Forums" rel="tag">WordPress Support Forums</a>, the incredible free WordPress Themes created by imaginative and altruistic fans, the powerful WordPress Plugins created and shared by those who saw a challenge and found a solution, and the support and willingness of WordPress users to educate others on how to use the program and make it work better - there would be no community.</p>
<p>WordPress has inspired many to learn about coding, design, web development, marketing, but also how to be a part of a community. WordPress fans are the definition of the social web. With the passion that comes with learning and sharing WordPress tips, tricks, and techniques, they&#8217;ve founded a grassroots community, which led to WordPress meetups and social gatherings, and now to WordCamps around the world. </p>
<p><img src="http://lorelle.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/lizstrauss_glenda_lorelle_bwe.jpg" alt="" title="Liz Strauss, Glenda Watson Hyatt, and Lorelle VanFossen at Blog World Expo in Las Vegas 2008" width="418" height="397" class="alignright size-full wp-image-3074" />When I attend the many business and professional conferences to speak and present programs, it&#8217;s fairly serious. I&#8217;m there for business. They are there for business. It&#8217;s serious stuff.</p>
<p>When I walk through the door of a WordCamp event, I&#8217;ve found family. We&#8217;re instantly friends. We all know each other, and if we don&#8217;t, we will within a few moments. We&#8217;re risk takers and yet communal spirits, sharing the risk together. When one person pushes WordPress, we all benefit from the results. </p>
<p>As I interviewed people and asked the WordPress Community for help in discovering how WordPress changes lives, I knew I had to put faces on the many people who&#8217;ve had their lives transformed by their involvement in WordPress. In the first half of the video, I honor those whom I&#8217;ve known for several years since early in the development of WordPress, as well as a few new friends. Many of these people have gone from interested enthusiasts to friends of WordPress to employees of <a href="http://www.automattic.com/" title="Automattic - parent company of WordPress, WordPress.com, Akismet, BuddyPress, and more" rel="tag">Automattic</a>, the parent company of WordPress. By using WordPress and being involved in the community, they&#8217;ve built their businesses and reputation as WordPress experts, and in turn, powerful forces on the web.<br />
<span id="more-3072"></span><br />
Sure, any blogging platform can do that, but there is something about Matt Mullenweg and his vision for WordPress and blogging in general that brings people together to achieve more than they could alone. This is what changes people&#8217;s lives. Together, we&#8217;re stronger with WordPress than without.</p>
<p>Enjoy all the inspirational reasons WordPress fans offered for how and why WordPress changed their lives. And don&#8217;t forget to check out <a href="http://lorelle.wordpress.com/2008/10/01/glenda-watson-hyatt-how-wordpress-changes-her-life-daily/" title="How WordPress Changes Her Life Daily">Glenda Watson Hyatt: How WordPress Changes Her Life Daily</a>, the video made especially for the finale of my presentation.</p>
<h4>Video of How WordPress Changes Lives</h4>
<p>There are two versions of the video. The <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9HN81XSNYU" title="YouTube version of How WordPress Changes Lives">YouTube version</a> is low resolution and a smaller file size. The <a href="http://www.viddler.com/explore/Lorelle/videos/1/" title="Viddler version of How WordPress Changes Lives">Viddler version</a> is higher resolution and 138.5 meg file size. The video is ten minutes long. The transcription of the video is below.</p>

<h4>Transcription of How WordPress Changes Lives</h4>
<p>I haven&#8217;t found an easy way to add subtitles or captions to this Sony Vegas Movie Studio Platinum v9 program. Any help would be appreciated. Until then, this is the transcript of the video.</p>
<p><strong>Fairy Blogmother:</strong> <em>Hey, is this thing on. Hey. Is this on?<br />
Is it working? It&#8217;s not working.<br />
Bang! Bang! Hello, are you working.<br />
Ah, there we go.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>* Instrumental Music &#8220;When you wish upon a star&#8221; from Pinocchio *</em></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;When you wish upon a star, makes no difference who you are.<br />
Anything your heart desires will come to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If your heart is in your dream, no request is too extreme.<br />
&#8220;When you wish upon a star, as dreamers do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fate is kind. She brings to those who love<br />
The sweet fulfillment of their secret longing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Like a bolt out of the blue, fate steps in and sees you through.<br />
&#8220;When you wish upon a star, your dreams come true.&#8221;<br />

Theme authors such as Ian Stewart, Justin Tadlock and Darren Hoyt are just a few of the influential people pushing this concept. In order to try and grasp an understanding of child themes, I interviewed Ian Stewart of <a href="http://themeshaper.com/" target="_blank">Themeshaper.com</a>. His responses were so long, this interview will end up being published in two parts. Here is part 1.</p>
<p><strong>1. First off, could you please explain what Child themes are in the simplest way possible?</strong></p>
<p>A Child Theme is a WordPress theme that installs and activates just like any other WordPress theme—with 2 crucial differences. Firstly, it requires no PHP template files of it&#8217;s own to work. That&#8217;s because it uses the template files of a defined Parent Theme. The Parent Theme must be installed—but not activated—in your blog&#8217;s themes directory for the Child Theme to work.</p>
<p>Secondly, as of WordPress 2.7, template files located in your Child Theme folder will be used instead of the template file in your Parent Theme folder. Don&#8217;t like how the header is coded up for a particular theme you want to edit? Copy the header.php file from your Parent theme into your Child Theme folder and make the change there. WordPress, as of 2.7, will look for header.php (or any possible template file) in the Child Theme first and use the Child Theme template file instead. This new feature in WordPress 2.7 makes custom theming really exciting and even easier.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s really very simple to make your own Child Theme. So simple, I can tell you and your readers how to do it right here in four ridiculously easy steps. It&#8217;ll help you get your head around using a Child Theme if you follow along (<em>with a test blog</em>—this&#8217;ll be easy but our test theme isn&#8217;t going to be pretty).</p>
<p>1. Make a folder in your blog themes directory called &#8220;achildthemetest&#8221;.</p>
<p>2. Create a &#8220;style.css&#8221; file in that folder with the following code copy-pasted into that &#8220;style.css&#8221; file.</p>
<pre>/*
Theme Name: A Child Theme Test
Theme URI:
Description: Trying out a Child Theme with the classic theme
Author:
Author URI:
Template: classic
Version:
*/

/*
For the sake of simplicity we're going to import
the classic stylesheet and override the styles.
You don't have to do this though. You can just
start fresh with new CSS or copy over large chunks of
the original styles and edit them here.
*/
@import url(../classic/style.css);

/*
Now, for a demonstration, let's make all the anchors red.
*/
a {
color:red;
}</pre>
<p>3. Refresh your blog&#8217;s theme directory in the WordPress admin. You should see a theme called &#8220;A Child Theme Test&#8221;. It&#8217;s using the classic theme as a Parent Theme. If you look at the code  above you should see a line that starts with &#8220;Template&#8221; it&#8217;s there that we defined that Parent Theme as &#8220;classic&#8221;, the folder name of our Parent Theme (which could be any installed theme).</p>
<p>4. Activate your new Child Theme and check out your blog. Are all the links in the main content area red? Congratulations. You just made a WordPress Child Theme. You can now edit your WordPress theme of choice—in this instance, the Classic theme—through CSS alone without having to modify any of the original template files. (If you&#8217;re a more advanced WordPress developer you can also include a functions.php file in your Child Theme that lets you interact with WordPress and your themes just like a plugin. But that&#8217;s another story altogether.)</p>
<p><strong> 2. What are some of the benefits that child themes offer versus stand alone themes?</strong></p>
<p>There&#8217;s 2 main benefits for the end user when it comes to using a Child Theme versus editing a theme directly: Simplicity and Upgrade-readiness. To explain, I&#8217;ll tell you why I use a Child Theme of my own theme, <a title="http://themeshaper.com/thematic-for-wordpress/" href="http://themeshaper.com/thematic-for-wordpress/" target="_blank">Thematic</a>,<a href="http://themeshaper.com/thematic-for-wordpress/" target="_blank"></a> on ThemeShaper.com. That&#8217;s right, I&#8217;m not even editing my own theme directly on my own WordPress Theme blog.</p>
<p>Firstly, it really is just simpler. I currently have only 2 files in my Child Theme folder: style.css and functions.php. Everything else is coming from the same Thematic template files anyone can download and use. When I want to change the look of my theme, I do it in style.css. If I want to get really serious with theme changes, like, plugin-serious, I write some simple code in functions.php. I don&#8217;t think about my Parent Theme and, excepting the XHTML it eventually outputs and displays in my browser, I don&#8217;t even look at it. Except! Except when it comes time to upgrade.</p>
<p>When I need to upgrade Thematic, my Parent Theme, I can do so without worries. That&#8217;s because I haven&#8217;t touched the original template files. I haven&#8217;t edited the header. I haven&#8217;t edited the footer. I haven&#8217;t edited single.php. Or index.php. All my theme edits have been made in the stylesheet and functions file of my Child Theme.</p>
<p>Look at it this way: I have another blog I manage with a really fresh and distinctive design that I get compliments on all the time. Unfortunately, I made that design by hacking up and heavily modifying The Sandbox <em>version 0.6</em>. If I wanted to upgrade to a newer version of The Sandbox I&#8217;d have to recreate that design. That means I&#8217;d have to pull the theme apart, find all my changes, and reintegrate it with a newer version of the theme. If I&#8217;d made the modifications in a Child Theme upgrading would mean uploading a newer version of The Sandbox and, well, that&#8217;s it really. How long does it take to upload a theme? 10 seconds? When you&#8217;re using a Child Theme, upgrading turns from a day long affair into a 10 second chore that can be done while you&#8217;re reading weblogtoolscollection.com.</p>
<p><strong> 3. Based on what I&#8217;ve seen, the child theme trend is really starting to gain traction thanks in large part to you and other theme designers. How long has the ability to develop child themes been available for WordPress? If it&#8217;s been available to develop for some time now, why is it that we are only now starting to see heavy development in this area?</strong></p>
<p>As far as I can tell, Child Themes have been available since version 2.1. But I first heard about Child Themes when I entered the Sandbox Designs Competition (<a href="http://sndbx.org/" target="_blank">http://sndbx.org/</a>). Every entry there is a Child Theme that defines The Sandbox as it&#8217;s Parent Theme and modifies the theme with CSS alone. Consequently, I think a lot of the credit for popularizing Child Themes needs to go to Scott Wallick (<a href="http://www.plaintxt.org/" target="_blank">http://www.plaintxt.org/</a>), co-creator of The Sandbox and organizer of the Sandbox Designs Competition.</p>
<p>But that brings us to why I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s been much talk about Child Themes: I think there&#8217;s sort of a lack of faith amongst theme authors and users when it comes to what you can actually do with CSS. WordPress developer and theme author Ben Eastaugh thinks that &#8220;one reason it hasn&#8217;t been more widely publicized is that [modifying Parent Themes with CSS] wasn&#8217;t, as it stood, terribly useful&#8221; (<a href="http://extralogical.net/2008/08/theme-inheritance/" target="_blank">http://extralogical.net/2008/08/theme-inheritance/</a>). I&#8217;d disagree with that in principle but that sort of sums up the feeling of theme authors that have been ignoring this feature.</p>
<p>And, by the way, if you don&#8217;t think Child Themes can really do anything with CSS alone make sure you check out the winning entries in The Sandbox Designs competition (<a href="http://sndbx.org/results/" target="_blank">http://sndbx.org/results/</a>) or the oft-mentioned and linked to CSS Zen Garden (<a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/" target="_blank">http://www.csszengarden.com/</a>).</p>
<p>But regardless of what you think you can do with CSS alone, now that WordPress 2.7 let&#8217;s you overwrite Parent template files from your Child Theme I expect we&#8217;ll be seeing more and more people using them.</p>
<p>Plus, there&#8217;s a few other WordPress developments in the works that&#8217;ll likely further popularize this method of theme modifying. Namely, the WordPress.com Themes Marketplace and allowing GPL Child Themes to be released through the WordPress Theme Directory.</p>
<p><strong>4. Before we move on, could you explain what a theme framework is? Perhaps providing a few examples for the readers.</strong></p>
<p>In my mind, a Theme Framework would be a theme that, at the very least, was made with clear intentions of being used to develop further themes. A starting point theme if you will.  I think a <em>good</em> Theme Framework also shows consideration of, or planning for, what can be done with Child Themes, now and in WordPress 2.7+. And that&#8217;s because, really, you shouldn&#8217;t be touching a framework if you can help it.</p>
<p>Think of WordPress as a framework where the contents of the database are output in a controlled fashion by your theme. We don&#8217;t go in and tinker with the WordPress core in order to make our themes work better (well, some people do but that&#8217;s another story again). The same thing with a theme framework. We can modify the theme framework with our Child Themes and leave the framework pristine for easy, safe upgrades.</p>
